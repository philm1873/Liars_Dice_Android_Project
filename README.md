Liar’s Dice




Liar’s Dice is a game where each player is given a set of dice in a cup. A player can only see their own dice. They are each given a turn at guessing how many dice are showing a specific face (across all players’ dice). Other player’s then have to decide if this guess is true or false.


M.V.P.


Create a game that allows a user to play the “computer” at Liar’s Dice. The game should include:


1. A screen that shows the user’s dice, the number of dice the computer has, and the round number.
2. A Method to randomly generate both player’s dice.
3. Methods to randomly generate the choices the computer makes in each round.
4. During the computer’s turn, options for the user to call the computer’s guess true or false.
5. During the player’s turn, options for the user to “bid” (i.e. state how many dice have one specific face showing, with both the user and the computer’s dice taken together).
6. The ability to evaluate which player has won a round.
7. Removing one die from a losing player.




Extensions


1. Rather than randomly generating computer choices, base them on probabilities.
2. Rather than stating if they think an opposing player’s choice is true or false, allow to “bid up” or “bid down”; meaning a player can change the number on the opposing player’s bid.
3. Improve the U.I. to include dice images etc.
